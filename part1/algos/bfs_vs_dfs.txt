If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

BFS

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 

BFS (DFS will take very long time)

If the tree is very wide:

DFS (BFS will need too much memory, too many nodes on a level)

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

DFS 

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:

DFS

Finding the shortest path:

BFS
